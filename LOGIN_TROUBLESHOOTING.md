# üîê Login Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue: "Invalid login credentials" after signing up

### Root Cause
Your Supabase project likely has **email confirmation enabled** by default. This means users must verify their email before logging in.

### Solution Steps

#### For New Users:
1. **Sign up** with your email and password
2. **Check your email inbox** (including spam folder)
3. **Click the confirmation link** in the email from Supabase
4. **After clicking the link**, you'll be redirected to the reset password page
5. **Now try logging in** with your credentials

#### Alternative: Disable Email Confirmation (For Development)

If you want to skip email confirmation during development:

1. Go to your **Supabase Dashboard**
2. Navigate to **Authentication** ‚Üí **Providers**
3. Click on **Email**
4. Toggle **OFF** the "Confirm email" option
5. Click **Save**

Now new signups won't require email confirmation!
