## Implementation Notes

### Success Notifications
All notifications use this pattern:

const successMsg = document.createElement('div');
successMsg.style.cssText = 'position: fixed; top: 2rem; right: 2rem; background: #4CAF50; color: white; padding: 1rem 2rem; border-radius: 8px; z-index: 999999; animation: slideIn 0.3s ease;';
successMsg.textContent = '‚úÖ Action completed successfully!';
document.body.appendChild(successMsg);
setTimeout(() => successMsg.remove(), 3000);
```

### Error Handling Pattern
```javascript
try {
    // Database operation
    const { error } = await supabase.from('trading_rules').insert(...);
    
    if (error) {
        console.error('‚ùå Error:', error);
        alert('Failed: ' + error.message);
    } else {
        console.log('‚úÖ Success');
        // Show success notification
        // Reload data
    }
} catch (error) {
    console.error('‚ùå Unexpected error:', error);
    alert('An error occurred: ' + error.message);
}
```

## Console Logging for Debugging

The system now includes comprehensive logging:
