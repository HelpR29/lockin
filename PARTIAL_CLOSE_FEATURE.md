# ✅ Partial Close Feature

## New Professional Trading Feature

### **What It Does:**
Instead of closing your entire position at once, you can now close **part of it** - just like professional traders do!

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### **Example Scenario:**
You have 3 NVDA call contracts:
- Entry: $180
- Current price: $185.8
- Position size: 3 contracts

### **User Flow:**

1. **Click "✅ Close Trade" button**

2. **Prompt 1: How many to close?**
   ```
   How many contracts do you want to close?
   
   Total position: 3
   Enter amount (1-3): _
   ```
   - You can enter: 1, 2, or 3
   - Default suggestion: 3 (full close)

3. **Prompt 2: Exit price?** (if not already set)
   ```
   Enter exit price for 2 contracts: 185.8
   ```

4. **Confirmation:**
   ```
   Partial close:
   
   Symbol: NVDA
   Amount: 2 of 3
   Entry: $180
   Exit: $185.8
   
   This action cannot be undone.
   ```

5. **Result:**
   - Creates NEW closed trade: 2 contracts @ $185.8 ✅
   - Updates original trade: 1 contract still open 🟢
   - Awards +10 XP
   - Calculates P&L for closed portion

---

## 📊 What Happens Internally

### **Full Close (e.g., 3 of 3 contracts):**
1. Updates existing trade:
   - `status` → 'closed'
   - `exit_price` → $185.8
2. P&L calculated on full position
3. Trade disappears from "open" list

### **Partial Close (e.g., 2 of 3 contracts):**
1. Creates **NEW trade entry** (closed):
   - Symbol: NVDA
   - Position size: 2 contracts
   - Entry: $180
   - Exit: $185.8
   - Status: 'closed'
   - Notes: "Partial close of NVDA (2/3)"

2. Updates **original trade** (still open):
   - Position size: 3 → 1 (remaining)
   - Status: still 'open'
   - Adds note: "Partial close: 2 closed at $185.8, 1 remaining"

3. Result: You see TWO trades:
   - ✅ **Closed trade**: 2 contracts (shows P&L)
   - 🟢 **Open trade**: 1 contract (still active)

---

## 💰 P&L Calculation

### **Full Close:**
```javascript
P&L = (Exit - Entry) × Full Size × Multiplier × Direction
```

**Example:**
```
NVDA: 3 contracts
Entry: $180
Exit: $185.8
Direction: Long

P&L = (185.8 - 180) × 3 × 100 × 1
    = 5.8 × 3 × 100
    = $1,740 profit ✅
```

### **Partial Close:**
```javascript
Closed P&L = (Exit - Entry) × Closed Size × Multiplier × Direction
Remaining = Still calculating (position open)
```

**Example:**
```
Closed 2 of 3:
P&L = (185.8 - 180) × 2 × 100 × 1
    = 5.8 × 2 × 100
    = $1,160 profit ✅

Remaining 1 contract:
P&L = TBD (still open)
```

## 🎓 Professional Trading Strategies Enabled

### **1. Scaling Out**
```
Entry: Buy 5 contracts @ $100
Target 1: Sell 2 @ $110 (lock in profit)
Target 2: Sell 2 @ $120 (more profit)
Target 3: Sell 1 @ $130 (ride the winner)
```

### **2. Risk Management**
```
Entry: 3 contracts @ $50
Price moves to $55 (+10%):
  - Close 1 contract (take profit)
  - Keep 2 running (free ride)
  - Move stop to breakeven
```

### **3. Trailing Profits**
```
Entry: 10 shares @ $200
$210: Close 3 (bank 30% of position)
$220: Close 3 more (bank another 30%)
$230: Close remaining 4 (let winners run)
```
