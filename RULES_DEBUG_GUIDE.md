## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "No user found!" in console
**Problem:** Not logged in
**Solution:** 
1. Go to login page
2. Sign in
3. Return to rules page

### Issue 2: "Error fetching rules" with message about permissions
**Problem:** Database RLS (Row Level Security) might be too restrictive
**Solution:**
1. Check Supabase dashboard
2. Go to Authentication → Policies
3. Verify `trading_rules` table has proper policies:
   - SELECT policy for user's own rules
   - INSERT policy for user's own rules
   - UPDATE policy for user's own rules
   - DELETE policy for user's own rules

### Issue 3: Rules added but console shows "Loaded 0 rules"
**Problem:** Database might have rules under different user_id
**Solution:**
1. Open console
2. Type: `supabase.auth.getUser().then(d => console.log('User ID:', d.data.user.id))`
3. Note your user ID
4. Check Supabase dashboard → Table Editor → trading_rules
5. Verify rules have YOUR user_id

### Issue 4: Page doesn't reload after adding rule
**Problem:** JavaScript error preventing reload
**Solution:**
1. Check console for errors (red text)
2. Look for "Uncaught" or "TypeError"
3. Report the error for fixing

### Issue 5: Alert shows error message
**Problem:** Database operation failed
**Solution:**
1. Note the exact error message
2. Common errors:
   - "duplicate key" = rule already exists
   - "permission denied" = RLS policy issue
   - "column does not exist" = database schema mismatch

## Manual Database Check

### Check if rules exist in database:

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard**
   - Go to https://supabase.com
   - Open your project
   - Click "Table Editor"

2. **View trading_rules table**
   - Find `trading_rules` table
   - Check if your rules are there
   - Verify they have your `user_id`

3. **If rules exist but don't show:**
   - Problem is with fetching/display
   - Check console for errors
   - Verify RLS policies allow SELECT

4. **If rules don't exist:**
   - Problem is with saving
   - Check console when adding rule
   - Look for error messages
   - Verify RLS policies allow INSERT

## SQL Query to Check Rules

Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Check your rules
SELECT 
    id,
    rule,
    category,
    is_active,
    created_at
FROM trading_rules
WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
ORDER BY category, created_at;
```

Expected result: List of all your rules

## Force Reload Test

If rules still not showing, try manual reload:

```javascript
// In browser console, run:
loadRules();

// Check what it returns:
supabase
    .from('trading_rules')
    .select('*')
    .then(data => console.log('Raw data:', data));
```

## Database Schema Verification

Your `trading_rules` table should have these columns:

```sql
id              uuid (primary key)
user_id         uuid (references auth.users)
rule            text (the rule description)
category        text (Risk Management, Entry Rules, etc.)
is_active       boolean (default true)
times_followed  integer (default 0)
times_violated  integer (default 0)
created_at      timestamp
updated_at      timestamp
```

### Check schema in Supabase:
1. Go to Table Editor
2. Click trading_rules
3. Click "..." menu → View definition
4. Verify all columns exist
