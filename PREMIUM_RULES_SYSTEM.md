## 💡 Strategy Behind This Approach

### 1. **Forces Commitment**
Users must choose their rules during onboarding when they're motivated and thinking clearly. This creates psychological commitment.

### 2. **Encourages Discipline**
Once rules are set, users can't easily change them. They must either:
- Follow their own rules (builds discipline)
- Upgrade to Premium to modify (monetization)

### 3. **Premium Justification**
Users who realize they picked wrong rules or need flexibility will see clear value in Premium:
- "I need to add a new rule I discovered"
- "This rule doesn't work for my strategy, need to edit"
- "I want to remove rules that aren't relevant"

### 4. **Data-Driven Insights**
By tracking which rules users follow/violate:
- Analytics show which rules work
- Reports highlight discipline weak points
- Premium can offer personalized rule optimization

## 🎨 UI/UX Design

### Onboarding Step 6 Features:

**Warning Message:**
```
⚠️ Important: After onboarding, editing/adding/removing 
rules requires Premium. Choose wisely!
```

**Rule Selection:**
- Scrollable container (max-height: 60vh)

- Checkbox + label (clickable)
- Hover effect (orange tint)

## 📊 Analytics & Reporting Impact

### What Gets Tracked:

Since users handpick rules during onboarding, analytics become more meaningful:

**Per-Rule Metrics:**
- Times Followed
- Times Violated
- Adherence % (calculated)
- Impact on P&L
- Correlation with winning trades

**User Insights:**
- Which rules they follow best
- Which rules they break most
- Rules that correlate with profits
- Rules that need review

**Premium Upsell Triggers:**
- User violates same rule 5+ times → "Need to edit this rule? Upgrade to Premium"
- User has 100% adherence on all rules for 30 days → "Add more rules with Premium"
- User's selected rules don't cover important areas → "Add recommended rules with Premium"

## 🎓 User Education

### Onboarding Tips (Add to Step 6):

"**Tips for Selecting Rules:**
- ✅ Start with 10-20 rules (don't overwhelm yourself)
- ✅ Include at least 3 Psychology rules
- ✅ Choose rules you can actually measure
- ✅ Pick rules specific to your trading style
- ⚠️ Remember: You'll need Premium to change these later!"

### Help Documentation:

**"Why can't I edit my rules?"**
> During onboarding, you selected your trading rules. This creates commitment and discipline. To edit, add, or delete rules, upgrade to Premium.

**"Can I change my rules later?"**
> Yes! Premium members can edit, add, or delete rules anytime. Free users can only toggle rules on/off.

**"How many rules should I select?"**
> Most successful traders follow 15-25 rules. Quality over quantity - choose rules you'll actually follow!
